# IC Tester

This is an IC tester for any type of logic chip. The device pules every pin combination and reads the all other pins to find which type of chip it is. The chip would have been already analysed before testing.

To read a 28 pin chip would take about 1/2 days and Thisbe is why I made the device be able to select the number pins of the chip to Be Tested. The larger the number of pins the slower it will read.

The device USB a sheld that attaches to an Arduino mega development board. The sheld has an LCD, SD and a user interface as well as the chip reader. To test the chip, the device uses 5v from the Arduino.
